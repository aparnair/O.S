# O.S Hardening

# Scenario


You are a cybersecurity analyst for yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. A former employee has decided to lure users to a fake website with malware. 

The baker executed a brute force attack to gain access to the web host. They repeatedly entered several known default passwords for the administrative account until they correctly guessed the right one. After they obtained the login credentials, they were able to access the admin panel and change the website’s source code. They embedded a javascript function in the source code that prompted visitors to download and run a file upon visiting the website. After embedding the malware, the baker changed the password to the administrative account. When customers download the file, they are redirected to a fake version of the website that contains the malware. 

Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed yummyrecipesforme’s helpdesk. They complained that the company’s website had prompted them to download a file to access free recipes. The customers claimed that, after running the file, the address of the website changed and their personal computers began running more slowly. 

In response to this incident, the website owner tries to log in to the admin panel but is unable to, so they reach out to the website hosting provider. You and other cybersecurity analysts are tasked with investigating this security event.

To address the incident, you create a sandbox environment to observe the suspicious website behavior. You run the network protocol analyzer tcpdump, then type in the URL for the website, yummyrecipesforme.com. As soon as the website loads, you are prompted to download an executable file to update your browser. You accept the download and allow the file to run. You then observe that your browser redirects you to a different URL, greatrecipesforme.com, which contains the malware.  

**The logs show the following process:**

The browser initiates a DNS request: It requests the IP address of the yummyrecipesforme.com URL from the DNS server.

The DNS replies with the correct IP address. 

The browser initiates an HTTP request: It requests the yummyrecipesforme.com webpage using the IP address sent by the DNS server.

The browser initiates the download of the malware.

The browser initiates a DNS request for greatrecipesforme.com.

The DNS server responds with the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.

The browser initiates an HTTP request to the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.

A senior analyst confirms that the website was compromised. The analyst checks the source code for the website. They notice that javascript code had been added to prompt website visitors to download an executable file. Analysis of the downloaded file found a script that redirects the visitors’ browsers from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com. 

The cybersecurity team reports that the web server was impacted by a brute force attack. The disgruntled baker was able to guess the password easily because the admin password was still set to the default password. Additionally, there were no controls in place to prevent a brute force attack. 

Your job is to document the incident in detail, including identifying the network protocols used to establish the connection between the user and the website.  You should also recommend a security action to take to prevent brute force attacks in the future.

# How to read the tcpdump traffic log


This reading explains how to identify the brute force attack using tcpdump. 


14:18:32.192571 IP your.machine.52444 > dns.google.domain: 35084+ A? yummyrecipesforme.com. (24)

14:18:32.204388 IP dns.google.domain > your.machine.52444: 35084 1/0/0 A 203.0.113.22 (40)


The first section of the DNS & HTTP traffic log file shows the source computer (your.machine.52444) using port 52444 to send a DNS resolution request to the DNS server (dns.google.domain) for the destination URL (yummyrecipesforme.com). Then the reply comes back from the DNS server to the source computer with the IP address of the destination URL (203.0.113.22). 




14:18:36.786501 IP your.machine.36086 > yummyrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [S], seq 2873951608, win 65495, options [mss 65495,sackOK,TS val 3302576859 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0

14:18:36.786517 IP yummyrecipesforme.com.http > your.machine.36086: Flags [S.], seq 3984334959, ack 2873951609, win 65483, options [mss 65495,sackOK,TS val 3302576859 ecr 3302576859,nop,wscale 7], length 0


The next section shows the source computer sending a connection request (Flags [S]) from the source computer (your.machine.36086) using port 36086 directly to the destination (yummyrecipesforme.com.http). The .http suffix is the port number; http is commonly associated with port 80. The reply shows the destination acknowledging it received the connection request (Flags [S.]). The communication between the source and the intended destination continues for about 2 minutes, according to the timestamps between this block (14:18) and the next DNS resolution request (see below for the 14:20 timestamp). 


TCP Flag codes include:


Flags [S]  - Connection Start 
Flags [F]  - Connection Finish 
Flags [P]  - Data Push
Flags [R]  - Connection Reset
Flags [.]  - Acknowledgment

14:18:36.786589 IP your.machine.36086 > yummyrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [P.], seq 1:74, ack 1, win 512, options [nop,nop,TS val 3302576859 ecr 3302576859], length 73: HTTP: GET / HTTP/1.1




The log entry with the code HTTP: GET / HTTP/1.1 shows the browser is requesting data from yummyrecipesforme.com with the HTTP: GET method using HTTP protocol version 1.1. This could be the download request for the malicious file. 



14:20:32.192571 IP your.machine.52444 > dns.google.domain: 21899+ A? greatrecipesforme.com. (24)

14:20:32.204388 IP dns.google.domain > your.machine.52444: 21899 1/0/0 A 192.0.2.172 (40)

14:25:29.576493 IP your.machine.56378 > greatrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [S], seq 1020702883, win 65495, options [mss 65495,sackOK,TS val 3302989649 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0

14:25:29.576510 IP greatrecipesforme.com.http > your.machine.56378: Flags [S.], seq 1993648018, ack 1020702884, win 65483, options [mss 65495,sackOK,TS val 3302989649 ecr 3302989649,nop,wscale 7], length 0


Then, a sudden change happens in the logs. The traffic is routed from the source computer to the DNS server again using port .52444 (your.machine.52444 > dns.google.domain) to make another DNS resolution request. This time, the DNS server routes the traffic to a new IP address (192.0.2.172) and its associated URL (greatrecipesforme.com.http). The traffic changes to a route between the source computer and the spoofed website (outgoing traffic: IP your.machine.56378 > greatrecipesforme.com.http and incoming traffic: greatrecipesforme.com.http > IP your.machine.56378). Note that the port number (.56378) on the source computer has changed again when redirected to a new website.
